---- Proof ----  



ASYNCH :

Non terminal path : A moves toward B (fair scheduler)
                    No exits
If Gathering is complete : B1 or B2 will be reached
                           Leads to F7 or F5
                           Which leads to B1 or B2 

Asynch is a winning subset of configurations



FAULTY 1 :

Non terminal path leads to ASYNCH

If gathering is complete : leads to F5 --> ASYNCH
                                    B1 --> ASYNCH
                                    F8 --> ASYNCH ou FAULTY 1

Asynch is a winning subset of configurations



FAULTY 2 :

Can be entered through FSYNCH
Non terminal path leads to either FAULTY 1
                                  FSYNCH with wrong targets

If gathering is complete : no change in behavior

FAULTY 2 poses a threat to win the gathering



FSYNCH :

Non terminal path leads to either : ASYNCH 
                                    FAULTY 1
                                    FAULTY 2
If gathering is complete : A1    --> F1    --> A1
                           A1    --> F9    --> A1
                           A2    --> F2/F8 --> A2 / FAULTY1 / ASYNCH 
                           A2    --> FAULTY 1
                           A6    --> F6    --> A1/A6
                           A3/A4 --> F3/F4 --> A1/A3/A4
                                     A1
                           
Asynch is a winning subset of configurations



FAULTY 2 :

No entry points
Non terminal path leads to either FAULTY 1
                                  FSYNCH with potentially wrong targets

If gathering is complete : no change in behavior
