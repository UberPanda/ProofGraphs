---- Proof ----  

Asynch :

Non terminal path : A moves toward B (fair scheduler)
                    No exits
If Gathering is complete : B1 or B2 will be reached
                           Leads to F7 or F5
                           Which leads to B1 or B2 

Asynch is a winning subset of configurations
